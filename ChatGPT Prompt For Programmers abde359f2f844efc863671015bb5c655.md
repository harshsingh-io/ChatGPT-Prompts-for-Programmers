# ChatGPT Prompt For Programmers

Welcome to the eBook containing my personal collection of prompts for ChatGPT related to programming and automation of tasks related to programming. By collecting and categorizing these prompts, my goal was to create a database that would help with learning programming and scripting. These prompts are intended for people who already have some knowledge about programming but want to continue developing and expanding their skills.

In the eBook, you will find suggestions from various fields. Most of the proposals are independent of programming language.

I strongly believe that this collection of prompts will be useful for you and will help you to develop much faster.

How to use this? The first step is to copy the prompt and paste it into ChatGPT. Keep in mind that the chat's behavior will not be deterministic. You may get different results than I do. Feel free to modify the prompts and see what works best for your workflow. However, if you stop at the first step (copy-pasting), you won't be able to fully utilize the tool's potential.

What should you keep in mind? Some prompts have a placeholder for your language/technology. In that case, replace "[LANGUAGE]" with Java or Python, or whatever you want. Do something crazy. Ask for pseudocode in Greek. ChatGPT is a conversational bot - remember that you can refer to the previous part of the conversation to clarify or ask questions. You can even tell the chat directly that the expected result is different and ask it to correct itself.

You will notice that some prompts are similar to each other. That's intentional. Experiment on your own to see what differences you get in responses when you change the initial "act as" to something else.

The answers you get are a starting point, not a solution. Copying ChatGPT's responses directly is a hundred times more dangerous than copying answers from Stack Overflow.

If you discover any new, interesting instructions, let me know!

Enjoy faster coding!
